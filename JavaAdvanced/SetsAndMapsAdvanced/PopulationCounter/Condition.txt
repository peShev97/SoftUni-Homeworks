So many people! It’s hard to count them all. But that’s your job as a statistician.
You get raw data for a given city and you need to aggregate it. 
On each input line you’ll be given data in format: "city|country|population".
There will be no redundant whitespaces anywhere in the input.
Aggregate the data by country and by city and print it on the console.
For each country, print its total population and on separate lines the data for each of its cities.
Countries should be ordered by their total population in descending order and within each country, the cities should be ordered by the same criterion.
If two countries/cities have the same population, keep them in the order in which they were entered.
Follow the output format strictly!
