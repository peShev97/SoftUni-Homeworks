Create a generic data structure that can store any type that can be compared. Implement functions:
•	void add(T element)
•	T remove(int index)
•	boolean contains(T element)
•	void swap(int index, int index)
•	int countGreaterThan(T element)
•	T getMax()
•	T getMin()
Create a command interpreter that reads commands and modifies the custom list that you have created. Implement the commands:
•	Add <element> - Adds the given element to the end of the list
•	Remove <index> - Removes the element at the given index
•	Contains <element> - Prints if the list contains the given element (true or false)
•	Swap <index> <index> - Swaps the elements at the given indexes
•	Greater <element> - Counts the elements that are greater than the given element and prints their count
•	Max - Prints the maximum element in the list
•	Min - Prints the minimum element in the list
•	Print - Prints all elements in the list, each on a separate line
•	END - stops the reading of commands

Extend the previous problem by creating an additional Sorter class.
It should have a single static method sort() which can sort objects of type CustomList containing any type that can be compared.
Extend the command list to support one additional command Sort:
•	Sort - Sort the elements in the list in ascending order.

For the print command you have probably used a for loop.
Extend your custom list class by making it to implement Iterable.
This should allow you to iterate your list in a foreach statement.
