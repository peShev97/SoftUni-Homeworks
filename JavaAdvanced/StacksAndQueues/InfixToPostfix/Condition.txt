Mathematical expressions are written in an infix notations, for example "5 / ( 3 + 2 )".
However, this kind of notation is not efficient for computer processing, as you first need to evaluate the expression inside the brackets,
so there is a lot of back and forth movement.
A more suitable approach is to convert it in the so-called postfix notations (also called Reverse Polish Notation),
in which the expression is evaluated from left to right, for example "3 2 + 5 /".
Implement an algorithm that converts the mathematical expression from infix notation into a postfix notation.
Use the famous Shunting-yard algorithm.
