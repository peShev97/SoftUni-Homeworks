You are given a matrix (2D array) of lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9), a starting position
– defined by a start row startRow and a start column startCol – and a filling symbol fillChar.
Let’s call the symbol originally at startRow and startCol the startChar.
Write a program, which, starting from the symbol at startRow and startCol, changes to fillChar every symbol in the matrix which:
•	is equal to startChar AND
•	can be reached from startChar by going up (row – 1), down (row + 1), left (col – 1) and right (col + 1) and “stepping”
ONLY on symbols equal startChar 
So, you basically start from startRow and startCol and can move either by changing the row OR column
(not both at once, i.e. you can’t go diagonally) by 1, and can only go to positions which have the startChar written on them.
Once you find all those positions, you change them to fillChar. 
In other words, you need to implement something like the Fill tool in MS Paint, but for a 2D char array instead of a bitmap.
