Create 3 different string collections – AddCollection, AddRemoveCollection and MyListImpl.
The AddCollection should have:
  Only a single method add(String) which adds an item to the end of the collection.
The AddRemoveCollection should have:
  An add(String) method – which adds an item to the start of the collection.
  A remove() method which removes the last item in the collection.
The MyListImpl collection should have:
  An add(String) method which adds an item to the start of the collection.
  A remove() method which removes the first element in the collection.
  A used field which displays the size of elements currently in the collection.
Create interfaces which define the collections functionality, think how to model the relations between interfaces to
reuse code. Add an extra bit of functionality to the methods in the custom collections, add methods should return
the index in which the item was added, remove methods should return the item that was removed.
Your task is to create a single copy of your collections, after which on the first input line you will receive a random
amount of strings in a single line separated by spaces - the elements you have to add to each of your collections.
For each of your collections write a single line in the output that holds the results of all add operations separated by
spaces (check the examples to better understand the format). On the second input line you will receive a single
number - the amount of remove operations you have to call on each collection. In the same manner as with the add
operations for each collection (except the AddCollection), print a line with the results of each remove operation
separated by spaces.
