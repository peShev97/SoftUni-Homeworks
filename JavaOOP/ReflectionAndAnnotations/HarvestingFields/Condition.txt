You are given a RichSoilLand class with lots of fields (look at the provided skeleton). Like the good farmer you
are, you must harvest them. Harvesting means that you must print each field in a certain format (see output).

Input

You will receive a maximum of 100 lines with one of the following commands:
  private - print all private fields
  protected - print all protected fields
  public - print all public fields
  all - print ALL declared fields
  HARVEST - end the input

Output

For each command you must print the fields that have the given access modifier as described in the input section.
The format in which the fields should be printed is:
"<access modifier> <field type> <field name>"
