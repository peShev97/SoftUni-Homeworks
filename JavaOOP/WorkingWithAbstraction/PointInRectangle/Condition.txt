Create a class Point and a class Rectangle. The Point should hold coordinates X and Y and the Rectangle should hold
2 Points – its bottom left and top right corners. In the Rectangle class, you should implement a contains(Point
point) method that returns true or false, based on whether the Point given as attribute is inside or outside of the
Rectangle object. Points on the side of a Square are considered inside.
